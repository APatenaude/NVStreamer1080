# NVStreamer1080
Utility to automatically detect NVidia GameStream activity and set a fitting resolution or switch to a second screen.

Written for personal use, so don't expect too much, it basically:

1. Either changes resolution or
2. Switches to the external display

when it detects GameStream activity, then afterwards depending on mode

1. Returns to the original resolution
2. Returns to the internal display
